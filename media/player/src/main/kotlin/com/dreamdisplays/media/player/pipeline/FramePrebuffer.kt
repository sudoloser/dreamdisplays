/**
 * Optional jitter buffer that decouples decoding from playout, eliminating the cold-start / network-stall
 * freeze. Without it both video pipes run a single thread that decodes one frame, paces it (sleeping), and
 * publishes it into the one-slot [FrameSurface]; while that thread is blocked waiting for the next frame
 * (network stall, cold seek) there is nothing new to show and the picture freezes.
 *
 * With a prebuffer the reader thread becomes a pure producer (decode -> [submit], blocking when full so
 * it never runs unbounded), and a dedicated consumer thread paces frames against the audio clock and
 * presents them into the same ready slot. A stall now blocks only the producer; the consumer keeps
 * presenting from the queue, so playback stays smooth until the cushion drains. The audio master clock
 * ([onFirstFrame]) is started only once the queue has pre-filled, so playback begins with a head start.
 * The very first decoded frame is presented immediately as a preview (before the prefill completes),
 * so starts and seeks show the target picture as soon as one frame exists.
 *
 * Enabled by default ([prefillFrames] is derived from `dreamdisplays.playback.prebufferMs`, default 400 ms);
 * set the property to 0 to keep the original inline pace-and-publish path.
