/**
 * Plays a URL that already is the media: a video file, an HLS playlist, or a DASH manifest.
 *
 * This is the resolver behind custom videos. Where the platform resolvers turn a page into
 * streams, this one confirms that a link is media and hands it to the player unchanged — no
 * subprocess, no extractor, one HTTP probe. That makes a pasted file play about as fast as the
 * decoder can open it, instead of paying a `yt-dlp` spawn for a URL that needed no extraction.
 *
 * It also claims [MediaSource.Remote], which is what makes "paste anything" work: a URL with no
 * recognizable extension is probed first, played directly when the server says it is media, and
 * otherwise refused so the chain falls through to `yt-dlp` exactly as before. The probe costs one
 * round trip on a path that was about to spawn a subprocess anyway.
